# firststepsdjango
This project represents my first steps in learning Django and Python
the project is a Django-based blog application. It includes functionalities to display a blog index page, a page listing all posts, and individual post details. The posts are stored as a list of dictionaries, each representing a blog post with attributes such as slug, image, author, date, title, excerpt, and content.

The principale function retrieves the latest three posts and displays them on the index page. The blog function displays all the posts on a dedicated posts page. The blogdetails function renders the details of a specific post based on its slug.
